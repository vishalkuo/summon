# Summon (A.K.A. Genie)

## About
Summon is a realtime service app that allows customers at restaurants to connect to the restaurant's server hub when they scan a QR code with an Android device. The customers will maintain a session with that hub as long as they remain on the restaurant's Wi-Fi. During that time, they can use the Summon app to quickly refills, their check, or type in their own custom request. Since this project was created for the toast hack-a-thon, it also has the capability to query the toast database to download the latest menu from the restaurant so that a customer can quick order from this app without having to wait for a server to come over. The server, connected through a simple live webpage, will receive updates indicating which table is requesting what and how many requests that customer has made.
